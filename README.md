# S.DS.P - PS module for manipulation with LDAP directories
This is repo for source code development for S.DS.P PowerShell module that's available on PowerShell Gallery here: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Using-SystemDirectoryServic-0adf7ef5 

Feel free to contribute; current functionality:
- Searching objects via Find-LdapObject
- Adding objects via Add-LdapObject
- Modifying objects via Edit-LdapObject
- Removal of objects via Remove-LdapObject
- Getting information about LDAP server via Get-RootDSE

Looking for testers against non-MS LDAP servers and more complex functionality (copying from object to object, transformations of objects, etc).
